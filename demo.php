					<p><strong>Paragraph -</strong></p>
					<p>The Pimpri Chinchwad Education Trust (PCET) was established by the Late Shri. S.B. Patil in the September of 1990. Its sole mission was aimed at serving society, the industry and all stakeholders through value-inculcating, quality education in the area of schooling, as well as professional tutelage in the fields of engineering, management and computer applications.<p>

					<p>PCET has always been committed to its mission by creating, communicating, preserving and applying knowledge, art and academic values.<p>

					<p>At the campus at Akurdi, Pune, near 7,200 students are being groomed in specialised courses like Engineering, MBA, MCA & PGDM by professional and passionate instructors. The campuses at Ravet are school to 1,200 would-be graduates at the College of Engineering, around 800 pupils at the Junior College, and approximately 2,500 students at the Public School, all amounting to a total of 11,700-odd students.<p>
